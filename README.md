Gitask
======
A task management tool based on git, python, and your file system.


How it Works
------------
Gitask is a set of simple python scripts that helps teams manage tasks effectively without any complex software or expensive services. This is possible because Gitask stores information as files and folders locally on your computer and uses git to synchronize data between multiple users; just like how we use git to share data and coordinate with other people.
