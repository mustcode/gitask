Gitask
======
A task management tool based on git, python, and your file system.


How it Works
------------
Gitask is a small set of simple python scripts that help teams manage tasks effectively without any complex software or expensive services behind it. What makes Gitask special is that Gitask stores all information as files and folders locally on your computer and uses git to synchronize data between multiple users. Just like how we use git to store our project files and coordinate among team members.
